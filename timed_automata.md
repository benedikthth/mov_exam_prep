# Timed Automata
## Motivation
Many real-time systems depend on timing. 
InCCS timeouts were modelled using non-determinism
too abstract for certain questions(avg. time to send message)

## Definition
TLTS is a trip;e (proc Act {arrowa | a in act})

Clock constraints: 
    g, g2, g3, 

cannot have $\vee$ because then $\lnot$ convex 

## Example
